My name is Ariel and I am a Network/Systems Administrator. My focus for this blog is to write about technology I am interested in, such as: Azure, Bicep, powershell, networking, routing, firewalling and any other tech topics I might be interested in.

Ultimately though this is just for the sake of creating a blog. Something to do and what I consider "fun".  This site has been built with Hugo and is running on Github pages.
